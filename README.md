### About Me ðŸ‘‹

I am 37 years old, i am from Argentina, i started programming when i was a kid, my father passed on his passion for programming to me. Although I ended up studying computer networks. And now after studying Full stack web developer at SoyHenry Bootcamp i feel like i rediscovered my passion for developing and creating solutions. I am also like to compose music, meditate and hiking. I like to work in a team and share with all my skills and have fun together!
